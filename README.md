UWSP Graduation Cap

Big thanks to the idea and guide off of [Idrees's Graduation Cap](https://idreesinc.com/about-graduation.html)

A lot of my code is based off his scripts in [here](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Graduation-Cap)

But, the bash script and crontab to keep the scripts running, even when the device is rebooted, was my idea c:
